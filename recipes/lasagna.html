    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      During a visit to Italy several years ago, I gathered as many authentic
      lasagna recipes as I was given. The chefs and home cooks gave me a lot of
      tips, too. As a result, I can honestly say that this is the best lasagna
      recipe I’ve ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lasagna is the epitome of comfort food, and it tastes so much better when
      it’s made from scratch. Not only that, but it’s a traditional Christmas
      dinner for many Italians.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (28-oz.) can whole tomatoes, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>2 (6-oz.) cans tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 tsp. salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp. Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp. garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 (8-oz.) package lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 cup (4 oz.) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup ricotta or small curd cottage cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brown ground beef in oil in a large skillet, stirring to crumble; drain
        off pan drippings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir tomatoes, tomato paste, and seasonings into meat. Bring to a boil;
        reduce heat and simmer 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>Cook noodles according to package directions; drain.</li>
      <li>
        Place half of noodles in a lightly greased 12 x 8 x 2-inch baking dish,
        slightly overlapping lengthwise edges. Spoon one-third of meat mixture
        over noodles; add half of shredded mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan
        cheese. Repeat layers, and spoon on remaining meat mixture. Arrange
        mozzarella slices on top.
      </li>
      <li>Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes.</li>
