    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Need a simple meal that’s restaurant quality? Try a Tuna Steak! Tuna
      steaks are one of our favorite easy meals because they’re high protein and
      cook up in a flash: just 2 to 4 minutes! The flavor is melt-in-your-mouth
      meaty: with a salty, seasoned exterior and a buttery, raw interior. You’ll
      want to use sushi grade fish here. Sear it up in a hot pan, and it’s one
      of the most impressive meals you can make!

    <!-- Recipe ingredients -->

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 steaks (8 ounces) high quality ahi tuna (sashimi grade recommended;
        wild caught if possible*)
      </li>
      <li>½ tablespoon neutral oil</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>
      <li>For serving: Garlic Herb Sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Recipe steps -->

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Allow the tuna steak to come to room temperature by letting it stand for
        at least 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat the tuna dry. Sprinkle it liberally with kosher salt and fresh
        ground black pepper on both sides to get a nice even coating (about ¾
        teaspoon kosher salt for 8 ounces).
      </li>
      <li>Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Add the tuna steak and cook 1 to 2 minutes per side, until lightly
        browned on the outside but still rare on the inside. The tuna will
        continue cooking while sitting. For a medium-rare tuna steak, the
        internal temperature should be 130 degrees Fahrenheit when measured with
        a food thermometer at the thickest point.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool for 2 minutes. Then slice the tuna against the grain into ½-inch
        slices and serve immediately, with the sauce if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
