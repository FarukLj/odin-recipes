    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve had a couple of days of glorious warm weather up here in North Wales
      which got me thinking about barbecues. When it comes to barbecues as a
      family we’re quite traditional and tend to stick to sausages and burgers
      (actually I like all sorts of different things – ribs, chicken, kebabs…
      but I’m in a family of BBQ fussiness so I tend to stick to what everyone
      else wants!).
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500 g good quality beef mince</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pre-heat your grill/barbeque</li>
      <li>
        Place the beef mince in a large bowl and break it up slightly with your
        hands.
      </li>
      <li>Cook noodles according to package directions; drain.</li>
      <li>
        Season with salt (I use about ¼ tsp) and carefully mix it with your
        hands to ensure it is evenly spread – if you’re unsure you’ve added the
        right amount of seasoning then simply fry a little bit in a small pan to
        taste before carrying on.
      </li>
      <li>Divide the mince into 4 and roll each into a ball</li>
      <li>
        Place the balls down on a work surface and pat them to make them
        flatter. Use your hands to push the sides in slightly so they make an
        even(ish) circle – you don’t need to completely squish them, they don’t
        need to be too tightly compacted, just enough to hold them together. If
        there’s any mince trying to escape, gently pinch it together with the
        burger.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place into the heated grill/barbeque and cook for 12-15 minutes until
        cooked through, turning halfway through the cooking time.
      </li>
      <li>Serve.</li>
    </ol>
